# Traffic-Flow-Modelling-and-Simulation

- The Traffic Flow Modelling and Simulation project involved the creation of a traffic flow model using the Lax-Friedrichs Scheme, as well as the derivation of various relationships between major traffic parameters such as density, flow, space, and time. This project utilized Python programming language, along with pre-installed libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy.optimize, and plotly.graph_objs.
- The Lax-Friedrichs Scheme is a numerical method for solving partial differential equations, and it was used in this project to model traffic flow. The model created using this scheme was able to simulate traffic flow and provide insights into how different traffic parameters affect each other.
- **`The project involved the derivation of various relationships between traffic parameters. For example, the relationship between traffic density and flow was examined to understand how changes in traffic density affect the flow of traffic. Additionally, the relationship between space and time was studied to gain insights into the relationship between traffic speed and travel time.`**
- In addition to deriving relationships between traffic parameters, the project also involved the creation of a best-fitted line representing flow. This was accomplished using Python libraries such as NumPy and scipy.optimize to perform a linear regression analysis on the data.
