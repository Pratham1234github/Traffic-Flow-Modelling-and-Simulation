# Traffic-Flow-Modelling-and-Simulation

Traffic Flow Modelling and Simulation is a project that involves creating a simulation of traffic flow in a road network using computer software. The goal of the project is to model and analyze the performance of the road network in terms of traffic congestion, travel times, and other relevant metrics.
To create a traffic flow simulation, a scenario is defined which includes a road network, traffic flows, and other relevant parameters. 
The simulation can be used to analyze different scenarios, such as varying traffic densities, different road network configurations, and different traffic flow patterns. The simulation output can be used to evaluate the performance of the network in terms of metrics such as average speed, travel time, and throughput.
Traffic flow modelling and simulation can be used for a variety of purposes, such as planning and design of road networks, evaluating the impact of new development on traffic flow, and optimizing traffic management strategies. The project can be used in both urban and rural areas, and can be applied to different modes of transportation, such as cars, trucks, buses, and bicycles.
used Laxâ€“Friedrichs Scheme for defining the traffic parameters
